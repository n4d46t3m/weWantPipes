# weWantPipes

For now there are only pipes that you should copy in the pipe folder of your **Angular** projects.
Don't forget to include pipes in the right components.
These pipes can be easily *translated* from **Typescript** to **Javascript**.

# TODO

- Angular project skeleton with a little demo
- Add more pipes !!!
- Translate pipes from Typescript to Angular
